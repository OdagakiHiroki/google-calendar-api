    - Customize the full event vs Customize the full event content
    基本的な機能を残しつつカスタムするか(contentのみ)、全部カスタムするか
    ```
    Mobiscroll takes care of rendering the events in the correct order and also prints basic fields, like start/end, whether it is an allDay event or not and also takes care of coloring the event appropriately. Everything else comes from the custom rendering function.
    ```
    ```
    Mobiscroll will position the event to the right place and will render essential information like the color of the event, the time and if it's an all day event or not. The title, description and any other fields you want to show (like participants, an avatar...) will be coming from your custom function.
